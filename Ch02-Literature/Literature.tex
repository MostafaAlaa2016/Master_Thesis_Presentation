\begin{frame}[fragile]{Literature Review: Detecting Arabic poems meters}

\begin{block}{Deterministic Approach}
	There is some literature on recognizing the meters of written Arabic poems using rule-based deterministic algorithms.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item <1-> [--] \textbf{Abuata and Al-Omari~\cite{Abuata2016RuleBasedAlgorithm}}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<2-> Deterministic Algorithm
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Getting the input, carrying full diacritics.
			\item Metrical scansion rules are applied to the Arud writing. 0/0/..
			\item Grouping zero and ones to feet \textarabic{تفعيلات}.
			\item A class is assigned  to the input.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item<3-> \textbf{\alert{Results}}: 82.2\% of 417 verses.
	\end{itemize}
	\item <4->[--]\textbf{Alnagdawi et al.~\cite{Alnagdawi2013FindingArabicPoemMeter}}, similar approach;  Context-Free Grammar; 75\% correctly
	classed from 128.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Machine Learning approach: Our point of departure}
\begin{itemize}
\item <1-> Building the first intelligent model capable to learn meters from poems.
\item <2-> Contributing the first public available dataset of 1.7M for scientific computing.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item<2-> Dataset size.
%\item<3-> Diacritics are essential.
%\item<4-> Converting verses into \textit{Al-Arud} writing style is probabilistic.

%\item[--]<5-> Detection issues:
%
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item<6-> For detecting meters, all models are naive \textbf{and primitive}. They provide no clue as to the real pattern.
%	\item<7-> Accuracies: (75\%, 82\%) tested on (128, 417) verses respectively.
%	
%	% A source of randomness.
%	%s. Treating such a problem as a deterministic problem will not satisfy the case study. It results in many limitations, including obligating verses to have full diacritics on every single letter before conducting the classification

%	\item<8-> Encoding technique.
