\begin{frame}[fragile]{Detecting Arabic poems meters}

\begin{block}{Deterministic Approach}
	There is some literature on recognizing the meters of written Arabic poem using rule-based deterministic algorithms
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Machine Learning Approach}
Learning and classifying poems to the right meter has not been addressed before!
\end{block}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Deterministic Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item <1-> [--] \textbf{Abuata and Al-Omari}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> Deterministic Algorithm
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Getting the input, carrying full diacritics.
		\item Metrical scansion rules are applied to the Arud writing. 0/0/..
		\item Grouping zero and ones to feet \textarabic{تفعيلات}.
		\item A class is assigned  to the input.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item<3-> \textbf{\alert{Results}}: 82.2\% of 417 verses.
\end{itemize}
\item <4->[--]\textbf{Alnagdawi et al}, similar approach;  Context-Free Grammar; 75\% correctly
classed from 128.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Our point of departure}
Issues;
\begin{itemize}
\item Dataset size.
\item Accuracies: (75\%, 82\%) tested on (128, 417) verses respectively.
\item Diacritics are a must.
% A source of randomness.
%s. Treating such a problem as a deterministic problem will not satisfy the case study. It results in many limitations, including obligating verses to have full diacritics on every single letter before conducting the classification
\item Converting verses into Al-Arud writing style is probabilistic.
\item For detecting meters, all models are so \textbf{naive and primitive}. They do no have any clue about the real pattern.
